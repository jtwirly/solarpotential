This project aims to reveal the untapped potential of solar energy across the globe by comparing the theoretical solar power potential of countries with their actual solar installations. By integrating the Global Photovoltaic Power Potential dataset with the Global Energy Monitor's Solar Power Tracker, we focus on projects over 20 MW to analyze disparities and highlight opportunities. This comparison not only identifies areas with significant solar resources that are yet to be harnessed but also showcases regions that have made remarkable strides in solar adoption. Our project is crucial for stakeholders in the energy sector, providing a clear picture of the solar landscape, guiding policy development, and encouraging investment in areas with high solar potential but low actualization, all while navigating the complexities of geography, infrastructure, and economic factors.
